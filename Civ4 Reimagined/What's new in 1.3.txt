Changes

-Achers and Longbowman gain additional defense bonuses from defensive buildings such as walls and castles. Before offensive units with higher ST would benefit more from walls/castles thant he dedicated city defenders, making balancing them tricky. Reduced city defense (Longbowman only) and increased costs  to compensate.

Tweaks

-Axemen bonus vs Archer reduced from 30% to 25%.

-New ancient building: Tannery (+2[g], -1[h], costs 90[p], +1[hap] from deer, fur). Available with Leather Working.
-Archery replaced with Leather Working. Archers moved to Hunting.
-Removed Totem Pole and added a tannery as unique building for Native Americans.
-New game option to disable the worker limit.
-New game option to disable modern unhappiness in colonies.
-All leaders have the same base attitude and instead gain a relationship bonus when they don't have enough open border contracts.
-Tech cost for all players scale with handicap setting. This should result in a more consistent game speed across difficulty levels. Feedback on the modifiers is highly appreciated.

Changes
*********
-Redestributed bonuses for fur, deer, wine and whale across market, grocer, supermarket and tannery.
-Horseback Riding requires Leather Working instead of Iron Working but at increased cost.
-Changed the way "balanced resources" map option works: Every player now has at least one copper, iron and oil near his starting position instead of exactly one of each.
-Production penalties for insufficient strategic resources are halved. Example: With a ratio of 0.8 and 1 Iron, your production speed for swordsman will be 90% (-20% for a 0.8 ratio, halved to -10%).
-Great Generals are always born in capital
-All diplomacy modifiers expire eventually. Harsher modifiers such as "nuked us" take more time to be forgotten than smaller ones such as "made demand".
-No blockade gold from barbarian cities
-Slaves can no longer be captured by players without slavery
-Bombarding city mechanic slightly changed. Castles are always targeted before Walls with a small chance to destroy other buildings. Success chance no longer depends on number of buildings in the city

*********
