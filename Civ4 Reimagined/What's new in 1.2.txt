Good news for french players: juni_be_good is working on a french translation for Civ4 Reimagined and has already translated a whole chunk. Thanks!
If you are interested in improving Civ4 Reimagined by translating or otherwise, just drop us a message.

-Tech Archery replaced with Leather Working. Archers are available with Hunting. Horseback Riding requires Leather Working instead of Iron Working but has increased cost.
-New building: Tannery. Moved happiness bonus for fur from market to tannery. Deer provides happiness with tannery instead of health with supermarket.
-All leaders have the same base attitude. There is a relationship bonus in place instead when a civilization doesn't have enough open borders.
-Adjusted tech costs to incorporate Leather Working change
-Due to popular demand: Added game option to disable the worker limit.
-Slightly increased technology progression for medieval+.
-Production penalties for insufficient (strategic) resources are halved. Example: With a ratio of 0.8 and 1 Iron, your production speed for swordsman will be 90% (-20% for a 0.8 ratio, halved to -10%).
-Wine health bonus from grocer replaced with happiness bonus from market. Whale provides health instead of happiness (you still get happiness with market though).
-Uranium yield with mine changed from 3 additional commerce to 1 additional production
-Railroad building time reduced from 400 to 200
-Tyranny upkeep cost increased from low to medium
-Tank production cost increased from 180 to 200
-Modern Armor production cost increased from 240 to 260
-Movement speed for Corporation ships increased from 4 to 6
-Commerce yield from gold/silver/gems reduced by 1
-Academy grants +1 scientist slot.
-No improvement building speed penalty for tundra terrain
-Great Generals are always born in capital
-All diplomacy modifiers expire eventually (Really, "Your spy was caught stirring up trouble" was such a big deal that the -1 modifier persisted for thousands of years?). Harsher modifiers such as "nuked us" take more time to be forgotten than smaller ones such as "made demand".
-"You agreed to come to our aid in war-time." already existed, but was never used. Entering war on behalf of an AI player now finally grants a small diplomacy bonus.
-Some AI adjustments when deciding which technology to research next.
-AI doesn't cancel deals as often as before
-New game option to disable modern unhappiness in colonies.
-Improved city resource display, which can now show up to 99 of each resource without overlapping.
-Deer and fur appearance increased on most map types
-Switched rarity for gold and silver.
-Building preview shows estimated commerce gain for bonus trade routes
-Different unit art for a couple units: German horseman (looked too advanced for classic tech unit), Japanese axeman (using two swords prior to swordsmen was a bit unfair), Roman caravel and Arab/Babylon/Carthage/Celtic/Egypt/Ethiopian/Malinese/Persian/Sumer frigate (suffering from looking to old/frail and unable to go over the ocean - the model was pretty, but it was hard to tell whether it was a ship of war or a fishing boat).
-Fixed display for gold per happiness resource from Mercantilism.
-Maximum number of specialists (i.e. "Max: 6") shows up again even when the number of specialists allowed was doubled
-Fixed unit buttons for celtic and zulu tanks.
-Fixed a bug where old BtS Texts were showing up instead of our new ones.
-Fixed a bug where units could be upgraded without having the appropriate resources when playing with the mercenary civic
-Fixed city trade route display now showing custom house oversea trade modifier
-Fixed various event help texts
-Slaves can no longer be captured by players without slavery
-Displays how much gold has been stolen by enemy spies
-Event log displays enemies that have withdrawn in yellow instead of red.
-Improved babylonian unique building text
-Improved slave unit texts, should help to determine how slaves are gained
-Pushed back the looter and marauder event into the renaissance. For an event that could destroy multiple buildings and improvements it could trigger awfully early.
-Changed the way "balanced resources" map option works: Every player now has at least one copper, iron and oil near his starting position instead of exactly one of each.
-Totestra map script: "Reduce peaks" is disabled per default
-Totestra map script no longer places starting position close to map boundaries.
