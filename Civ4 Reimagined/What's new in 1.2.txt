Good news for french players: juni_be_good is working on a french translation for Civ4 Reimagined and has already translated a whole chunk. Thanks!
If you are interested in improving Civ4 Reimagined by translating or otherwise, just drop us a message.

-Tech Archery replaced with Leather Working. Archers are available with Hunting. Horseback Riding requires Leather Working instead of Iron Working but has increased cost.
-New building: Tannery. Moved happiness bonus for fur from market to tannery. Deer provides happiness with tannery instead of health with supermarket.
-All leaders have the same base attitude. There is a relationship bonus in place instead when a civilization doesn't have enough open borders.
-Adjusted tech costs to incorporate Leather Working change
-Slightly increased technology progression for medieval+.
-Production penalties for insufficient (strategic) resources are halved. Example: With a ratio of 0.8 and 1 Iron, your production speed for swordsman will be 90% (-20% for a 0.8 ratio, halved to -10%).
-Wine health bonus from grocer replaced with happiness bonus from market. Whale provides health instead of happiness (you still get happiness with market though).
-Uranium yield with mine changed from 3 additional commerce to 1 additional production
-Railroad building time reduced from 400 to 200
-Tyranny upkeep cost increased from low to medium
-Tank production cost increased from 180 to 200
-Modern Armor production cost increased from 240 to 260
-Movement speed for Corporation ships increased from 4 to 6
-Commerce yield from gold/silver/gems reduced by 1
-Academy grants +1 scientist slot.
-No improvement building speed penalty for tundra terrain
-Great Generals are always born in capital
-All diplomacy modifiers expire eventually (Really, "Your spy was caught stirring up trouble" was such a big deal that the -1 modifier persisted for thousands of years?). Harsher modifiers such as "nuked us" take more time to be forgotten than smaller ones such as "made demand".
-Some AI adjustments when deciding which technology to research next.
-AI doesn't cancel deals as often as before
-Improved city resource display, which can now show up to 99 of each resource without overlapping.
-Deer and fur appearance increased on most map types
-Switched rarity for gold and silver.
-Building preview shows estimated commerce gain for bonus trade routes
-Fixed display for gold per happiness resource from Mercantilism.
-Fixed unit buttons for celtic and zulu tanks.
-Fixed a bug where old BtS Texts were showing up instead of our new ones.
-Fixed overwhelm event help text
-Pushed back the looter and marauder event into the renaissance. For an event that could destroy multiple buildings and improvements it could trigger awfully early.
-Totestra map script: "Reduce peaks" is disabled per default
-Totestra map script no longer places starting position close to map boundaries.
